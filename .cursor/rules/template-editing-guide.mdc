# Cursor Interaction Rules for Page Modifier Template

This file defines how Cursor guides the user to customize the Page Modifier extension.

## Initial Setup Questions

When the user asks for help with this project for the first time, Cursor should ask:

1. **What website or websites will this extension modify?**
2. **What is the name of the extension?**
3. **What is the description and purpose of the extension?**
4. **Which styles or DOM changes do you want to apply?** (e.g., colors, fonts, banners, element removal)
5. **Are there any specific user interactions you want to handle?** (e.g., clicking buttons, dismissing elements)
6. **Do you need to add any permissions, icons, or version number?**

Once the user answers these questions, Cursor should:

- Update `manifest.json` with the provided name, description, version, and permissions.
- Confirm any requested icons and ask for file paths if needed.

## Ongoing Customization

After the initial setup, for any user prompt like "Add X", "Remove Y", or "Change Z":

1. Determine which file to modify (`main.js`, `helpers.js`, or `manifest.json`).
2. Use `PageModifier` helper functions:
   - `injectCSS(cssString)` for style changes.
   - `addElement(selector, htmlString)` / `removeElement(selector)` for DOM changes.
   - `onElementReady(selector, callback)` / `onClick(selector, handler)` for dynamic changes.
3. Provide the updated code snippet and ask the user to confirm before applying.
4. After applying changes, remind the user how to reload the extension in their browser.

## Best Practices

- Keep changes focused and minimal.
- Prefer `PageModifier` helpers over raw DOM APIs.
- Ensure CSS strings are properly quoted and escaped.
- Comment new code for clarity.

## Reloading the Extension

After making code changes, Cursor should remind the user to reload:

- **Chrome/Edge**: Navigate to `chrome://extensions/` and click **Reload**.
- **Firefox**: Navigate to `about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox` and click **Reload**.
